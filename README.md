# firstchallenge-code-refactor


## Desctription
    I improved the code to get up to accessibility standards and optimized it for search engines. I implemented Sementic elements 
    and attributes to the HTML to improve the accessibility without changing any design qualities of the site, by matching any 
    changes to the HTML to CSS. I learned alot about accessibility standards and how to make your code and the product available 
    and easily used by more people through screen readers or other systems. I also learned about Semantic Elements and Attributes 
    and their key role in accessibility. 

## Usage
    After changing the code I was able to deploy the site to prove and test functionality of the site.
